This repository contains code for adapting stable diffusion for EEG to Image task.

The rightmost column is the ground truth image for an EEG Signal and the remaining columns are the generated images for that particular EEG signal.

This model was trained with limited number of iterations [ran out of GPU credits]. Further Improvements are definately possible by simply training for more epochs.
